# Project Process Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
- **Objective**: Real-time fraud detection on transaction data with a focus on accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.
- **Approach**: Utilized both traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN) and neural networks (LSTM, GRU, DNN) to effectively identify fraudulent transactions.

## 2. Data Handling
- **Feature Selection**: Performed using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to retain relevant features and reduce model complexity.
- **NaN Handling**: Removed NaNs from target and feature variables to ensure clean input data.
- **Data Scaling**: Applied `StandardScaler` for uniform feature scaling, essential for models sensitive to feature magnitude, especially neural networks.
- **Reshaping for Neural Models**: Reshaped input data to 3D format for LSTM and GRU models to process transaction sequences effectively.

## 3. Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employed Hyperband tuning for neural models (LSTM, GRU, DNN) to find optimal hyperparameters while managing computational resources.
- **Early Stopping**: Implemented early stopping in neural network training to halt training once validation performance plateaued, preventing overfitting.
- **Parallel Processing**: Enabled parallel processing (`n_jobs=-1`) to speed up training for tree-based models like Random Forest.
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Used dropout layers in neural networks for regularization, and optimized model architectures to mitigate overfitting risks.

## 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Sensitivity Priority**: Prioritized recall (sensitivity) over precision to maximize true fraud detection rates, a critical metric in this domain.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Used confusion matrices and classification reports to assess model performance, with a specific focus on recall for fraud cases.
- **Cross-Model Comparison**: Compared traditional machine learning models with neural networks to determine the best-performing, least overfitted model for fraud detection.
