# Real-Time Anomaly Detection for Fraudulent Transactions

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a real-time anomaly detection system to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. It leverages both basic and deep learning models to enhance accuracy and robustness in detecting fraud.

## **Dataset**
The project utilizes the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## **Installation**
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## **Usage**
Run the main script to start processing transactions and detecting anomalies:
```bash
python main.py
## **Future Work**
We will explore advanced deep learning models, including autoencoders and LSTMs, to further improve detection accuracy. These models will help us capture complex fraud patterns and detect anomalies more effectively. Performance comparisons with the basic models will also be included.
## **Documentation**
Comprehensive documentation is provided through GitHub Actions to ensure up-to-date details on all code functions, model choices, and experimental results. The documentation includes explanations of model performance, evaluation metrics, and additional insights. See the workflows directory for automatic documentation updates.
